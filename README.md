# Word & Character Counter

A small project to explore Next.js, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS concepts:

- Resuable, well-typed components
- Handling state & props with clear separation of concerns
- Clean, "inline" styling

I may build on this as I go, but, for now, it's in a fairly good state for what it is.
